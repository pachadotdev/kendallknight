## About

tldr; This package implements a different algorithm from the one implemented in
base R, and it reduces the complexity of the Kendall's correlation coefficient
from O(n^2) to O(n log n) resulting in a runtime of nano seconds or minutes
instead of minutes or hours. This package is written in C++ and uses cpp11 to
export the functions to R. See the vignette for the mathematical details.

[Buy Me A Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/pacha). All donations will
be used to continue improving `kendallknight`.

## Installation

You can install the development version of kendallknight like so:

``` r
remotes::install_github("pachadotdev/kendallknight")
```

## Examples

See the documentation: https://pacha.dev/kendallknight.

# Benchmarks

We tested the `kendallknight` package against the base R implementation of the
Kendall correlation using the `cor` function with `method = "kendall"` for
randomly generated vectors of different lengths. The results are shown in the
following table:

| implementation  | number of observations | median time | memory allocation |
|-----------------|------------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| kendallknight   | 100                    |  37 us      |  52 KB            |
| base R          | 100                    | 265 ms      | 129 KB            |
| kendallknight   | 1,000                  | 173 us      |  67 KB            |
| base R          | 1,000                  |  22 ms      |  75 KB            |
| kendallknight   | 10,000                 |   2 ms      | 665 KB            |
| base R          | 10,000                 |   2 s       | 743 KB            |
| kendallknight   | 100,000                |  22 ms      |   6 MB            |
| base R          | 100,000                |   4 m       |   7 MB            |

In order to avoid distorted results, we used the `bench` package to run the
benchmarking tests in a clean R session and in the Niagara supercomputer
cluster that, unlike personal computers, will not distort the test results due
to other processes running in the background (e.g., such as automatic updates).

# Testing

The package uses `testthat` for testing [@wickham2011]. The included tests are
exhaustive and covered the complete code to check for correctness comparing with
the base R implementation, checking corner cases, and forcing errors
by passing unusable input data to the user-visible functions.
