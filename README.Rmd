## About

tldr; If you have a 2-4GB dataset and you need to estimate a (generalized)
linear model with a large number of fixed effects, this package is for you. It
works with larger datasets as well and facilites computing clustered standard
errors.

'kendallknight' is a fast and small footprint software that provides efficient
functions for demeaning variables before conducting a GLM estimation. This
technique is particularly useful when estimating linear models with multiple
group fixed effects. It is a fork of the excellent Alpaca package created and
maintained by [Dr. Amrei Stammann](https://github.com/amrei-stammann). The
software can estimate Exponential Family models (e.g., Poisson) and Negative
Binomial models.

Traditional QR estimation can be unfeasible due to additional memory
requirements. The method, which is based on Halperin (1962) vector projections
offers important time and memory savings without compromising numerical
stability in the estimation process.

The software heavily borrows from Gaure (2013) and Stammann (2018) works on
OLS and GLM estimation with large fixed effects implemented in the 'lfe' and
'alpaca' packages. The differences are that 'kendallknight' does not use C nor Rcpp
code, instead it uses cpp11 and
[cpp11armadillo](https://github.com/pachadotdev/cpp11armadillo).

The summary tables borrow from Stata outputs. I have also provided integrations
with 'broom' to facilitate the inclusion of statistical tables in Quarto/Jupyter
notebooks.

If this software is useful to you, please consider donating on
[Buy Me A Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/pacha). All donations will
be used to continue improving `kendallknight`.

## Installation

You can install the development version of kendallknight like so:

``` r
remotes::install_github("pachadotdev/kendallknight")
```

## Examples

See the documentation: https://pacha.dev/kendallknight.

# Benchmarks

We tested the `kendallknight` package against the base R implementation of the
Kendall correlation using the `cor` function with `method = "kendall"` for
randomly generated vectors of different lengths. The results are shown in the
following table:

| implementation  | number of observations | median time | memory allocation |
|-----------------|------------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| kendallknight   | 100                    |  37 us      |  52 KB            |
| base R          | 100                    | 265 ms      | 129 KB            |
| kendallknight   | 1,000                  | 173 us      |  67 KB            |
| base R          | 1,000                  |  22 ms      |  75 KB            |
| kendallknight   | 10,000                 |   2 ms      | 665 KB            |
| base R          | 10,000                 |   2 s       | 743 KB            |
| kendallknight   | 100,000                |  22 ms      |   6 MB            |
| base R          | 100,000                |   4 m       |   7 MB            |

In order to avoid distorted results, we used the `bench` package to run the
benchmarking tests in a clean R session and in the Niagara supercomputer
cluster that, unlike personal computers, will not distort the test results due
to other processes running in the background (e.g., such as automatic updates).

# Testing

The package uses `testthat` for testing [@wickham2011]. The included tests are
exhaustive and covered the complete code to check for correctness comparing with
the base R implementation, checking corner cases, and forcing errors
by passing unusable input data to the user-visible functions.
