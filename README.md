## About

tldr; This package implements a different algorithm from the one
implemented in base R, and it reduces the complexity of the Kendallâ€™s
correlation coefficient from O(n^2) to O(n log n) resulting in a runtime
of nano seconds or minutes instead of minutes or hours. This package is
written in C++ and uses cpp11 to export the functions to R. See the
vignette for the mathematical details.

Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/pacha). All donations will be used to
continue improving `kendallknight`.

## Installation

You can install the development version of kendallknight like so:

``` r
remotes::install_github("pachadotdev/kendallknight")
```

## Examples

See the documentation: <https://pacha.dev/kendallknight>.

# Benchmarks

We tested the `kendallknight` package against the base R implementation
of the Kendall correlation using the `cor` function with `method =
"kendall"` for randomly generated vectors of different lengths. The
results are shown in the following table:

| Number of observations | kendallknight median time (s) | base R median time (s) |

In order to avoid distorted results, we used the `bench` package to run
the benchmarking tests in a clean R session and in the Niagara
supercomputer cluster that, unlike personal computers, will not distort
the test results due to other processes running in the background (e.g.,
such as automatic updates).

# Testing

The package uses `testthat` for testing \[@wickham2011\]. The included
tests are exhaustive and covered the complete code to check for
correctness comparing with the base R implementation, checking corner
cases, and forcing errors by passing unusable input data to the
user-visible functions.
