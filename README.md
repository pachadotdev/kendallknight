## About

tldr; This package implements a different algorithm from the one
implemented in base R, and it reduces the complexity of the Kendallâ€™s
correlation coefficient from O(n^2) to O(n log n) resulting in a runtime
of nano seconds or minutes instead of minutes or hours. This package is
written in C++ and uses cpp11 to export the functions to R. See the
vignette for the mathematical details.
