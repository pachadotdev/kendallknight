A numeric value between -1 and 1. kendall_cor() calculates the Kendall correlation coefficient between two numeric vectors. It uses the algorithm described in Knight (1966), which is based on the number of concordant and discordant pairs. The computational complexity of the algorithm is O(n (n))O(n log(n)), which is faster than the base R implementation in stats::cor(..., method = \"kendall\") that has a computational complexity of O(n^2)O(n^2). For small vectors (i.e., less than 100 observations), the time difference is negligible. However, for larger vectors, the difference can be substantial. By construction, the implementation drops missing values on a pairwise basis. This is the same as using stats::cor(..., use = \"pairwise.complete.obs\"). # input vectors -> scalar output x  matrix output x <- mtcars[, c(\"mpg\", \"cyl\")] kendall_cor(x) Knight, W. R.
