	abstract = {Although economists have long been aware of Jensen's inequality, many econometric applications have neglected an important implication of it: under heteroskedasticity, the parameters of log-linearized models estimated by OLS lead to biased estimates of the true elasticities. We explain why this problem arises and propose an appropriate estimator. Our criticism of conventional practices and the proposed solution extend to a broad range of applications where log-linearized equations are estimated. We develop the argument using one particular illustration, the gravity equation for trade. We find significant differences between estimates obtained with the proposed estimator and those obtained with the traditional method.},

It is a generalization of the within transformation to arbitrary number of category variables. The approach, unlike other fast methods for solving such problems, provides a covariance matrix for the remaining coefficients. The article also sets out a method for solving the resulting sparse system, and the new scheme is shown, by some examples, to be comparable in computational efficiency to other fast methods. The method is also useful for transforming away groups of pure control dummies. A parallelized implementation of the proposed method has been made available as an R-package lfe on CRAN.},

What about beef consumption and people getting struck by lightning? Absolutely not. But that hasn't stopped millions of people from going to tylervigen.com and asking, "Wait, what?" Vigen has designed software that scours enormous data sets to find unlikely statistical correlations. He began pulling the funniest ones for his website and has since gained millions of views, hundreds of thousands of likes, and tons of media coverage. Subversive and clever, Spurious Correlations is geek humor at its finest, nailing our obsession with data and conspiracy theory.},
