Dear Editors,

Please consider my manuscript presenting the kendallknight package, an efficient
implementation of Kendall's correlation coefficient tailored for computationally
intensive cases. It is of my interest to publish with Plos ONE because of its
open access policy.

My approach builds upon Knight's (1966) algorithm and subsequent literature,
significantly reducing computational complexity and achieving substantial speed
improvements over the Base R implementation.

The kendallknight package is especially beneficial for econometricians and
statisticians who require rapid and accurate computations of Kendall's
correlation and who use R. My benchmarks demonstrate notable performance gains
without compromising accuracy, and effectively handling edge cases.

I believe this contribution, which starts from rethinking correlation computation,
aligns well with the general scope of Plos ONE, offering practical improvements
for statistical computing.

Thank you for considering our submission.

Best regards,

MVS
